This is a simple guessing game I made. You can tell the computer a range of numbers and the computer will chose one number in that range. You then try to guess what number the computer is thinking.
I created this project with Java code. In this project, I used system inputs to take the users guess, as well as random number generator and comparison statements to check whether or not the user had guessed the right number.
I created this project as a way to practice my java programming skills.
